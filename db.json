'Disraeli Gears' represents the finest hour for British psychedelic rock power trio Cream, comprised of drummer Ginger Baker, bassist-vocalist Jack Bruce and none other than 'God' himself Eric Clapton on guitar. Squarely identifiable as a psychedelic rock album - Which took American blues, laced it with LSD and put it through a fuzz box - nonetheless this album, not to say the work of Cream itself, set the groundwork for heavier rock genres which came into full bloom in the following decade of the 1970s, such as progressive rock and - as much as former drummer Baker might detest it - heavy metal."

Coming off the heels of three classic albums ('Beggars' Banquet', 'Let it Bleed' and 'Sticky Fingers') the commitment and reverence of the 'Satanic Majesties' towards their American rhythm and blues and early rock and roll influences, at the same time cementing the Stones' distinctive approach and style of rock and roll."

Produced by Steve Rowland, 'Coming from Reality' shows a deeper level of maturity and at the same time, a sharper level of poignancy contrasted with its predecessor. The album closer for its original 1971 release, 'Cause' was a grim portrayal of life as a Detroit blue-collar worker. Its opening lines 'Cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmas' ended up being a prophetic statement by Rodríguez, he was dropped from his label Sussex two weeks before Christmas of 1971."

The ever-lingering influence of former frontman Syd Barrett - Who left the band years earlier due to mental health and drug abuse issues - is perceptible and the 14-minute epic 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' serves as an affectionate tribute to him."

Despite Mercury's demands to make a radio-friendly record, Rush instead went balls-out and took the greatest of risks:  2112's entire first side on vinyl is comprised of a seven-part space-rock-opera suite, which tells the story of a young man living under the tyrannical interplanetary rule of the Solar Federation, headed under the administration of the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx, who oppose any kind of individual expression as they deem it 'against the established order'. The life of our protagonist is turned upside down after finding an ancient artifact under a waterfall: A guitar. The risk paid off and '2112' was the album that made Rush a seriously-considered band"

Loaded with hits such as 'King of Pain', 'Synchronicity II', perhaps its most memorable track is the Sting-penned 'Every Breath You Take' which underneath its warm musical soundscape, contains a story of an unhealthy obsession and toxic, controlling relationship dynamics."

However, when said Texas bluesman - A certain Stevie Ray Vaughan - has  session musician credits for no one other than David Bowie, the chances for exposure grow exponentially. That is not to demean in any way the quality of this album, Vaughan thoroughly breaks through and shows a grounded, traditional and yet fresh and modern style of the blues, grounded on artists ranging from B.B. King to Jimi Hendrix."

Public enemy #1 of the conservative establishment and the 'voice' of the outcasts in the late 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, 'Holy Wood (In The Shadow of the Valley of Death)' while not carrying the bludgeoning impact that 1996's 'Antichrist Superstar', manages to top it off. This is Manson at his most iconoclastic, targeting his full lyrical and sonic assault against the hypocritical gun-toting, politicized right-wing Christianist American conservatives who at the time of the album's release thought Manson was THE Devil, darkly satirizing the phenomenon of celebrity worship as a religion on itself (Complete with John F. Kennedy as its Christ figure). 'New guy on the band' at the time, guitar virtuoso John 5 (John Lowery) functions very much as Manson's enforcer of sonic aggresion, delivering amazing guitar work even on the structurally simplest of fist pumpers such as 'The Fight Song'"

That being said, the album became a picture of the early George W. Bush presidency and at the same time, a timeless metal masterpiece. Every song is a peppered pummeler rife with poetry, wordplay and hidden meanings, delivered by Serj Tankian's powerful operatic, Middle Eastern vocals. "
